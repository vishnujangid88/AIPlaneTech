In our chatbot project, the three model files serve distinct but interconnected roles in making the chatbot function efficiently. Here‚Äôs their significance:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `chatbot_model.h5` (Trained Deep Learning Model)

- **What is it?**
  - This is the main **trained neural network model** stored in the HDF5 format (`.h5`).
  - It is created using **Keras + TensorFlow** and trained on labeled intent data.
- **Why did we make it?**
  - We trained this model using input-output pairs (bag-of-words representations of user queries and their corresponding intent labels).
  - It allows the chatbot to predict **which intent** best matches a user‚Äôs query.
- **What is it doing?**
  - When a user enters a query, the chatbot converts it into a bag-of-words (BoW) format.
  - The model takes this as input and outputs probabilities for different intent classes.
  - The chatbot selects the intent with the **highest probability** to determine the response.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `words.pkl` (Vocabulary List)

- **What is it?**
  - A **pickled list of words** used during training.
  - Contains **all unique words** extracted from the training dataset (after lemmatization and tokenization).
- **Why did we make it?**
  - To ensure that the chatbot processes new input in the **same format** as it was trained on.
  - Prevents reprocessing of words every time the chatbot runs.
- **What is it doing?**
  - When a user enters a sentence, it is broken down into words.
  - Each word is checked against this list to form a **bag-of-words vector**.
  - This vector is then passed to the model (`chatbot_model.h5`) for intent prediction.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `classes.pkl` (Intent Labels)

- **What is it?**
  - A **pickled list of intent labels** corresponding to different categories in the dataset.
- **Why did we make it?**
  - To store the **intent labels** that the model was trained to recognize.
  - Ensures that the chatbot always interprets predictions in the **same order**.
- **What is it doing?**
  - The model outputs probabilities for different intent indices.
  - These indices are mapped back to **actual intent labels** using this file.
  - The chatbot then selects the most probable intent and retrieves a response.

### üîó How They Work Together

1. **User enters a message** ‚Üí `chatbot_ui.py` preprocesses it.
2. **Bag-of-words representation** ‚Üí Using `words.pkl` to match words with known vocabulary.
3. **Predict intent** ‚Üí `chatbot_model.h5` predicts the most likely intent.
4. **Find intent label** ‚Üí Using `classes.pkl`, the predicted class index is converted into a text label.
5. **Generate response** ‚Üí The chatbot retrieves a response from `admission_data.json` based on the predicted intent.

This modular approach ensures that: ‚úÖ The model is efficient and doesn‚Äôt need retraining every time.  
‚úÖ The chatbot maintains consistency in predictions and responses.  
‚úÖ The system is scalable‚Äînew intents can be added without breaking the structure.
